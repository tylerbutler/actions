# Shared GitHub Actions

## Overview

Reusable composite actions for CI/CD workflows. Used across multiple repositories to standardize setup procedures.

## Actions

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `setup-gleam` | Gleam/BEAM environment with caching |
| `setup-go` | Go environment with optional mise tool management |
| `setup-rust` | Rust toolchain with caching |
| `setup-node` | Node.js with pnpm/npm/yarn/bun |
| `install-tools` | Install dev tools via taiki-e |
| `changie-release` | Batch changie entries and create release PR (single or multi-project) |
| `changie-auto-tag` | Create version tag(s) from latest changie release (single or multi-project) |
| `changie-check` | Detect PR-added changie fragments and render preview |

## Usage Pattern

From any repository:
```yaml
- uses: tylerbutler/actions/setup-gleam@v1
- uses: tylerbutler/actions/setup-rust@v1
- uses: tylerbutler/actions/setup-node@v1
```

## Structure

```
actions/
├── setup-gleam/
│   └── action.yml      # Gleam/BEAM setup
├── setup-go/
│   └── action.yml      # Go setup with optional mise
├── setup-rust/
│   └── action.yml      # Rust toolchain setup
├── setup-node/
│   └── action.yml      # Node.js setup
├── install-tools/
│   └── action.yml      # Generic tool installer
├── changie-release/
│   └── action.yml      # Changie release PR automation
├── changie-auto-tag/
│   └── action.yml      # Version tag from changie
├── changie-check/
│   └── action.yml      # PR changelog detection
├── README.md           # User documentation
└── LICENSE
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Version file support**: `setup-gleam` reads from `.tool-versions` by default
2. **Caching by default**: All setup actions cache dependencies
3. **just integration**: All actions install `just` task runner by default
4. **Flexible inputs**: Can override defaults for any use case

## Reusable Workflows

Reusable workflows live in `.github/workflows/` and are called with `uses:` from other repos:

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `auto-tag.yml` | Tags releases when release PRs merge (wraps `changie-auto-tag` action) |

## Multi-Project Support

Both `changie-release` and `changie-auto-tag` support changie's built-in `projects` feature for monorepos with independently-versioned packages.

### Prerequisites

The consuming repo's `.changie.yaml` must have `projects` configured:
```yaml
projectsVersionSeparator: "-"
projects:
  - label: my-package
    key: my-package
    changelog: CHANGELOG.md
  - label: my-package-plugin
    key: my-package-plugin
    changelog: packages/my-package-plugin/CHANGELOG.md
```

### changie-release with projects

```yaml
- uses: tylerbutler/actions/changie-release@main
  with:
    projects: my-package,my-package-plugin
    version-files: |
      my-package:Cargo.toml:version
      my-package-plugin:packages/my-package-plugin/Cargo.toml:version
```

**Behavior when `projects` is set:**
- Each project is batched independently with `changie batch auto --project X`
- Projects with no unreleased changes are skipped
- `version` output contains comma-separated versions: `my-package-v1.0.0, my-package-plugin-v0.2.0`
- `version-files` uses `project:path:key` format (three colon-separated fields)
- Only projects that were actually batched have their version files bumped
- Branch name uses `release/next` (since multiple versions don't make valid branch names)
- `batched-projects` output lists which projects had changes
- `version` input is ignored (auto is always used per-project)

### changie-auto-tag with projects

```yaml
- uses: tylerbutler/actions/changie-auto-tag@main
  with:
    projects: my-package,my-package-plugin
    create-release: true
```

**Behavior when `projects` is set:**
- Loops over all projects, gets latest version for each
- Skips tags that already exist (handles partial releases gracefully)
- Creates a GitHub Release per new tag (when `create-release` is true)
- Release notes sourced from `.changes/{project}/{version}.md`
- `created-tags` output lists only the tags that were actually created
- Tags are pushed in a single `git push` for atomicity

### auto-tag.yml reusable workflow with projects

```yaml
jobs:
  auto-tag:
    uses: tylerbutler/actions/.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml@main
    with:
      projects: my-package,my-package-plugin
      create-release: true
```

### Multi-Project Directory Structure

With projects configured, changie organizes files as:
```
.changes/
├── header.md
├── unreleased/            # All fragments, prefixed by project
│   ├── my-package-Added-20260228-....yaml
│   └── my-package-plugin-Fixed-20260228-....yaml
├── my-package/            # Per-project version files
│   └── v1.0.0.md
└── my-package-plugin/
    └── v0.2.0.md
```

### Backward Compatibility

Both actions are fully backward compatible:
- When `projects` input is empty (default), all behavior is identical to before
- Single-project `version-files` format (`path:key`) is unchanged
- All existing outputs work the same way for single-project repos

## Changie Action Gotchas

- `changie latest` returns versions with `v` prefix - `changie-auto-tag` default `tag-prefix` is empty to avoid `vv` tags. The `tag-prefix` input exists for monorepo/multi-package repos where tags need a package prefix (e.g. `mypackage/v1.0.0`)
- `changie batch auto` exits non-zero when no unreleased fragments exist - `changie-release` pre-checks the unreleased directory before calling batch
- `changie-release` reads `.changie.yaml` to find the unreleased directory path (`changesDir`/`unreleasedDir`)
- PR body template supports `{version}` and `{changelog}` variables resolved via bash substitution
- `changie-release` supports `version-files` input for bumping version in TOML files (only TOML is supported). Single-project format: `path:key` per line. Multi-project format: `project:path:key` per line. Only top-level keys are supported. Changes are included in the same commit as the changelog update via `peter-evans/create-pull-request`
- `changie-auto-tag` supports optional `create-release` input to create a GitHub Release with changie version notes. Uses `.changes/{version}.md` (or `.changes/{project}/{version}.md` for multi-project) as release notes if available, falls back to `--generate-notes`
- In multi-project mode, `changie-release` reads `projectsVersionSeparator` from `.changie.yaml` (defaults to `-`) to correctly parse version strings like `my-package-v1.0.0`
- In multi-project mode, the branch name template replaces `{version}` with `next` instead of the version string, since comma-separated versions aren't valid branch names

## Adding New Actions

1. Create new directory: `new-action/action.yml`
2. Follow composite action pattern
3. Add inputs with sensible defaults
4. Include caching where applicable
5. Update README.md with documentation

## Versioning

- Use semantic versioning tags (v1, v1.0.0)
- Major version tags (v1) should be updated to point to latest minor/patch
- Breaking changes require major version bump
